# moshi-osgi
This repository contains the MANIFEST.MF file of **the Eclipse plug-in project** for building OSGi bundle from the [moshi-parent-1.7.0](https://github.com/square/moshi/tree/moshi-parent-1.7.0) of [moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) and the built bundle file. You need Java 8 or higher.

I use this with the following bundles.
- [Okio 1.15.0](https://github.com/square/okio/tree/okio-parent-1.15.0)  
I use the pre-built [org.apache.servicemix.bundles.okio-1.15.0_1.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.servicemix.bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.okio/1.15.0_1) provided by [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

- [JSR 305 3.0.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305)  
I use [org.apache.servicemix.bundles.jsr305-3.0.2_1.jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.servicemix.bundles/org.apache.servicemix.bundles.jsr305/3.0.2_1) provided by [MVN Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/)

I would like to thank the authors of this very useful moshi code, and all the contributors.
